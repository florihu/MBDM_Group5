# MBDM Group 5: Final Assignment Submission
###This repository contains the files of group 5 for the final assignment of the course: EPA1361 - Model-based Decision-making. The files included are the jupyter notebooks used to develop the models, as well as the final report and political reflection. 
The repository is structured as follows: 

-The main jupyter notebooks used for the development of the project are numbered 1-5: 
  - 1-Exploratory Policy Analysis.ipnyb
  - 2-Scenario Discovery and PRIM.ipynb
  - 3-MORDM.ipynb
  - 4-MORDM_2.ipynb
  - 5-GSA.ipynb

-Data needed to run the model is included in the **data** folder  
-Data outputs from the different jupyter notebooks is included in the **data_output** folder

## Other considerations: 
dike_model_function.py was modified from the main epa1361_open repository (available at: https://github.com/quaquel/epa1361_open/tree/master/final%20assignment) which was used as the base for this assignment. 
This was done to extract the minimum water level from the model and include it in the main outputs.
